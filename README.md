## 🚀 Features

- Detects PPE items (helmets, vests, gloves, masks) in images or video streams.
- Modular pipeline for data preprocessing, training, and inference.
- Jupyter notebook demo for quick experimentation.
- Unit tests to ensure reliability of core functions.
- Easily extendable to new PPE categories.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PPE_SAFETY_DETECTION.git
cd PPE_SAFETY_DETECTION
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📊 Usage

### Run Inference
```bash
python src/main.py --input data/processed/sample.jpg --output results/
```

### Jupyter Notebook Demo
Open and run:
```bash
notebooks/ppe_detection_demo.ipynb
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Preparation** → Place raw images in `data/raw/`, preprocess into `data/processed/`.
2. **Model Training** → Train models and save checkpoints in `models/`.
3. **Inference** → Use `main.py` or notebook for detection.
4. **Evaluation** → Validate results using test scripts.
